## Functions which cache the inverse of a matrix.
## Objective : Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and 
## there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly

## Define function makeCacheMatrix which creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setInverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
  getInverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setInverse = setInverse,
       getInverse = getInverse)
}


## Define function cacheSolve which computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getInverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setInverse(m)
  m
}
